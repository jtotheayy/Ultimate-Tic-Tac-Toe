# Ultimate-Tic-Tac-Toe
 *This game is a large tic-tac-toe board, with smaller tic-tac-toe boards in each of the squares. Turns are taken in the small boards.

 *  At the beginning of the game, the player may start by clicking any square from any board. Here is an example of me playing the middle square in the middle board, then the computer, "O" plays the top-left of the middle board.

 * When a player makes a turn in the small tic-tac-toe board, then the next player plays in the small board that corresponds to the square the previous player played.
 * For Example: Player "X" plays their turn in the "middle-right" board, and in that board they play the square "top-middle". Now Player "O" is forced to play in the "top-middle" board and can click on any of the squares in that board.

 * If,"X" or "O" plays a square, where the corresponding board is already won (as shown above), then the other player can play their turn on any square, from any un-won boards.

 * Those are the rules, the goal is to create a three-in-a-row pattern in the large boards, like shown, and win the game!
